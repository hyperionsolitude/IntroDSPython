For instance, if the original list is [1, 12, 5, 3] then the sorted pairs lists would be [(3,1),(12,5),(12,3), (5,3), (5,1), (12,1)] where the divisions are [3, 2.4, 4, 1.66, 5, 12].

This will give us all possible pairs of numbers. We can then calculate the division of each pair(O(1)) and store it(O(1)) in a separate list. Finally, we can sort the pairs based on their division and return the sorted list.\n",
